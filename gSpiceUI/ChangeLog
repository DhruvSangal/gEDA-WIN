gSpiceUI - A Graphical User Interface (GUI) to various freely available electronic circuit
           simulation engines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Added a preferences option for synchronizing ambient temperature values between analysis pages
   and the OPTIONS dialogue.
 * Cleaned up the DlgPrefs class by removing all Get*( ) functions.
 * Added a preferences option to exclude the netlist file from the list of temporary files.
 * At startup, if a schematic file is open but a netlist file doesn't exist automatically generate
   the netlist file by performing an import operation on the schematic file thereby generating the
   netlist file. To date an error message was displayed.
 * Add help target to Makefile and src/Makefile, displays a help message listing available targets.
 * BugFix : Temporary files are deleted by the function FileTasks::bDelTmpFiles( ) which was
            suffering from some bit rot; it was leaving some temporary files behind.
 * When gschem is envoked by gSpiceUI command line options have been added to configure the
   appearance of gschem ie. light colour scheme, the status panel and side bar aren't displayed.
 * Added a target for cppcheck (a tool for static C/C++ code analysis) to src/Makefile.
 * Added a preferences option to enable gnetlist nomunge mode whereby component label
   prefixes are tested for correctness and if necessary the correct prefix is prepended to the
   component label eg. all resistors should have the prefix R.
 * Added a preferences option to set the tool tip delay.
 * gSpiceUI now automatically determines what gnetlist backends are available instead of using a
   hard coded list.
 * Added a preferences option to enable gnetlist verbose mode whereby debug spew is generated.
 * Added a preferences option to enable gnetlist include mode whereby model file contents can be
   inserted into the netlist file of an .INCLUDE directive be used.
 * Added a preferences option to enable gnetlist embed mode whereby .INCLUDE file contents can be
   inserted into the netlist file of the .INCLUDE directive is left untouched.
 * The configuration mechanism has been re-written and a dedicated Config claas has been introduced.
 * Updates to the usage message in class CmdLinePcr.
 * The class PrcSimEngBase inherits from the class PrcBase. The functions PrcBase::bLogOutput( ) and
   PrcSimEngBase::bSaveOutput( ) perform essentially the same job so the later has been removed.
 * The GUI controls are now properly locked out during operations that require this behaviour eg.
   import, reload, create netlist, etc.
 * In the File menu, "Exit" renamed to "Quit", seems to be more often used by other applications.
 * BugFix : Andrew Holmes has reported a bug which can result in gSpiceUI crashing. gSpiceUI is
            susceptible to entering an wxYield( ) loop when the GUI is accessed during a long
            simulation run. The GUI is now properly locked out during simulation runs and calls to
            wxYield( ) have all been replaced with calls to wxTheApp->Yield( ).
 * The result file the column width is no longer fixed at 14 chars. but is automatically set
   according to the maximum column label width or data field width. The result are now packed more
   tightly so more of the raw data can be viewed in the results file window.
 * The results plotting utility Gaw complains if the results file ends with an empty line so the
   last line is no longer empty.
 * A user (Dom) has reported that NG-Spice (and GNU-Cap) allow a DC sweep with negative step value.
   The code has been modified to allow a DC start value greater then the stop value, the sign of the
   step value is automatically adjusted in the simulation engine command.
 * gSpiceUI now displays more illuminating and consistant error messages if problems occur whilst
   running the simulation process or formatting the results.
 * BugFix : Over many the years a file named "prcbase.log" would occasionally appear amongst the
            netlist or schematic files. It is the default log file name for the PrcBase class but I
            couldn't determine why it was being used. The problem was in FrmMain::Initialize( ),
            FrmMain::InitLogFiles( ) must be called after FileTasks::Initialize( ) or the proper log
            file name wasn't set ie. "gspiceui.log".
 * BugFix : The wxWidgets class wxStringTokenizer assignment operator '=' is unreliable, in one case
            it caused a core dump. All instances of this usage of wxStringTokenizer have now been
            replaced with the function call wxStringTokenizer::SetString( ).
 * Following an inquiry from Eckard Klotz my curiousity got the better of me and I've determined a
   technique to building gSpiceUI on M$ Windoze. Basically, install MinGW, install the wxWidgets
   sources, build wxWidgets using MinGW, install the wxWidgets library, get the gSpiceUI sources and
   build gSpiceUI using MinGW. The end result : "gspiceui.exe" runs but is untested. Instructions
   have been added to the Install file in the gSpiceUI project root directory.
 * BugFix : Several Mac OSX users have reported a compiler bug caused by OnClose( ) event handlers
            in the class HelpTasks. Hiroshi Yoshikawa has offered a patch which I've used to develop
            a fix.
 * Documentation updates including basic information regarding using KiCAD and gSpiceIU.
 * Various minor updates and bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015-04-29 : M.Waters

 * Released version 1.1.00.
 * BugFix : In the NetList class the load file and load attributes operations have been separated to
            prevent redundant disk activity. SimnBase class has been modified in simpathy.
 * BugFix : In the Component class the type is determined based on the first character in the name
            eg. D1 is assumed to be a diode. If the component type couldn't be identified it was
            deemed invalid. This was a bit too harsh so now the component is assumed to be valid
            even if it's type can't be determined.
 * BugFix : The PnlValue control could be tripped up under certain circumstances if a value was
            manually entered (eg. enter 1.0V and decrement to 0.0V instead of 1000.0mV).
 * If a netlist loaded by gSpiceUI is found to be a valid simulation file it is now loaded into the
   Simulation console as well as the NetList console. Changes to FrmMain::bSimnLoad( ).
 * BugFix : In the simulation file an incorrect reference to schematic file/s could be included.
            This could occur if a .ckt wasn't derived from a .sch file.
 * gSpiceUI can now be compiled against wxWidgets v3.0.0 or v2.8.12. Hence forth development will be
   based around wxWidgets v3.0.0 so gSpiceUI may look prettier with this version of the library.
 * The delay between successive spin button control updates can now be set using the Preferences
   dialogue and the "Spin control period" parameter. Allowable values range from 20 to 400 mSec.
 * BugFix : Henry reported on 2010-10-04 that the command line option -g for importing schematic
            file/s was broken. This bug has now been rectified.
 * BugFix : If a PnlValue value outside the allowable range was manually entered, the spin buttons
            ceased to work. The event handlers now know what to do in this case.
 * Further development and testing of OPTIONS dialogue.
 * Comparison of floating point numbers isn't easy when the values are similar. Two new functions
   have been added to class CnvtType which compare floats ie. CnvtType::bIsEqual( ).
 * Significant upgrades to class PnlValue bSetValue( ) functions. This is due to testing done using
   the test application test_AppPnlValue.
 * It's not good practise to declare "using namespace" with global scope so all such declaration
   have been removed.
 * BugFix : The CnvtType class bParseFlt( ) functions could fail at certain boundary conditions
            around mantissa values of 1.0 and 10.0.
 * Added a test application directory src/tests. The first test application is test_AppPnlValue
   which is used to test the display control class PnlValue and all the classes it uses. It's
   getting too difficult to test GUI components inside gSpiceUI.
 * Support for temperature values in Degrees Kelvin and Fahrenheit has been dropped. Both NG-Spice
   and GNU-Cap only support Deg.C and the data-sheets for various electronic components I've checked
   only mention Deg.C. Supporting Deg.K & Deg.F properly in gSpiceUI would require significant
   effort which isn't justified given the maginal benefit to be gained.
 * Phase angle units are now set via the Preferences dialogue.
 * The preferences dialogue now includes an option to alter the main frame layout. Either the probes
   (nodes and components) lists extend the full height of the frame or (as normal) the text controls
   can expand to cover the full width of the frame at the expense of probe lists height.
 * BugFix : When setting a PnlValue the units where being ignored if the value to be set was zero.
            The function PnlValue::bSetValue( wxString & ) has been completely rewritten.
 * BugFix : If Source sychronization was enabled the sweep parameter units where not being updated
            for the DC analysis panels.
 * BugFix : In the class NbkNgSpice the result file width was not being calculated correctly meaning
            results could be lost.
 * In the classes CmdGnuCapOPT and DlgGcpCfgOPT have removed options which are no longer supported
   and included new options.
 * In Settings menu place Preferences item at the top.
 * Created a new class UnitsBase as a base class to ChoUnits and LblUnits.
 * Tidied up the layout of all configuration dialogues.
 * Created a new class LblUnits to be used as an attribute in the class PnlValue as the units label.
 * The layout of the analysis panels for both NG-Spice and GNU-Cap were showing a some bit rot.
   These panels have been updated.
 * Created a new class PnlLblTxt to replace some instances of the wxTextCtrl class. It provides much
   of the functionality of wxTextCtrl and adds a parameter name string displayed to the left of the
   wxTextCtrl control.
 * Created a new class PnlLblCho to replace some instances of the wxChoice class. It provides the
   functionality of wxChoice and adds a parameter name string displayed to the left of the wxChoice
   control.
 * Updates to the build system to suppress warnings when building with gcc and wxWidgets v2.8.12.
 * Convert all bool values to lower case "true" or "false" instead of upper case "TRUE" and "FALSE".
   There seems to be no reason to use upper case values hence the change.
 * BugFix : The class CnvtType was failing one test utility check. The method bIsFloat( ) was not
            detecting that a string like "123E-4" represents a float.
 * Updates to the build system for the test utilities (ie. in src/Makefile).
 * Change from the drawing package Xfig (and FIG drawing files converted to JPEG image files) to
   Inkscape (and SVG drawing files converted to PNG image files).
 * BugFix : Contributor "dcb" ran cppcheck on the gSpiceUI sources. Two non-sensical test
            expressions inside two if( ) statements were found in the file CmdGnuCapGEN.cpp. Both
            bugs have now been rectified. The rest of the sources passed the cppcheck tests OK.
 * Update to GPL license version 3.
 * Changed email address references.
 * gSpiceUI now responds appropriately if a binary file can't be found eg. gschem or gnetlist.
 * Major update of ConvertType class including a name change to CnvtType.
 * HTML documentation updates.
 * Many minor updates and bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-09-27 : M.Waters

 * Released version 1.0.00.
 * When gSpiceUI is installed example schematic files and library files are now included (this was
   always intended but overlooked).
 * gSpiceUI has been successfully compiled against the wxWidgets library version 2.9.2 (with
   wxWidgets 2.8 compatibility enabled). This was requested by a Mac OSX user Jerry J. since "it
   works better with the Cocoa framework".
 * BugFix : The temporary file management scheme was incomplete. If more than one circuit
            descriptions were loaded in a single session temporary files could be created but not
            deleted.
 * Modifications to the functions in utility/StrUtils.cpp. Signal source names are now sorted so
   that the most used component types appear at the top of the list.
 * Modifications to the functions in utility/StrUtils.cpp. The more interesting node and component
   names now tend to be placed at the top of the test probe list boxes and the remaining names are
   sorted more sensibly.
 * In the classes NetList, SimnBase, SimnGunCap and SimnNgSpice change all Extract*( ) function
   names to Load*( ).
 * BugFix : In version v0.9.99 a reload operation would close gschem and gwave or gaw. (This was
            unintended behaviour.)
 * In class SpinCtrl hard-coded a spin button repeat period of 80 msec. This may be user
   configurable in the future.
 * Increased the maximum number of lines which can be displayed in any text control to 1,000,000
   lines and the default to 10,000. (I don't know if wxTextCtrl can cope with this but someone will
   try it sooner or later and we'll find out).
 * Objects inheriting from PrcBase (which itself inherits from wxProcess) created input and output
   streams but didn't deleted them. Eventually all available file descriptors were used up and
   gSpiceUI could no longer launch new processes. This long standing bug has been resolved
   (I think?) thanks to a contribution made by Jarno H.
 * Added a LM555 model file and demo. schematic.
 * In the classes PrcGWave and PrcGaw removed the functions bFormatLine( ) and bFormatField( )
   because these operations are already performed by PrcGnuCap and PrcNgSpice.
 * Over-haul of the ChoUnits class.
 * In the PnlValue::bSetValue( ) methods remove unnecessary complexity by eliminating the bNoUnits
   argument; it's already implemented by the PnlValue::m_bUseUnits attribute.
 * BugFix : If a node label didn't start with a digit CmdGnuCapPR::Parse( ) categorized it as a
            component label.
 * BugFix : The src/Makefile target "deps" was not correctly defined. Most of the source files where
            being overlooked.
 * In HelpTasks class removed the status bar from the HTML window, it wasn't used.
 * Disable the Stop tool and Stop menu option when no simulation is actually running.
 * In the HelpTasks class added a tool to the tool bar for moving forward in the history database.
 * In the HelpTasks class implemented wxFrame close tool for HTML window.
 * Implemented a new command-line option -d which enables debug mode. This causes console spew to be
   generated on standard error.
 * At startup error messages are held over until the the main frame of the GUI has been fully
   displayed.
 * In src/Makefile added a new variable $DESTDIR which may be used to specify the install location
   at the request of Declan.
 * BugFix : The src/Makefile install mechanism failed if the target bin/ directory didn't already
            exist.
 * In the classes PnlValue, SpinCtrl and ChoUnits the method bClear( ) is used to set defaults.
   Added a function bSetDefaults( ) to set default values and changed the bClear( ) methods to just
   clear the object attributes.
 * Replace all references to wxWindows with wxWidgets.
 * Minor updates to Install documentation.
 * BugFix : The files utility/iStrCmp.h and utility/iStrCmp.c actually contain C++ code so they have
            been renamed to utility/iStrCmp.hpp and utility/iStrCmp.cpp respectively. Also removed
            instructions for compiling C code from Makefile.
 * In the class ConvertType all function for processing double float's take only double's of long's
   as arguments. (This is to do with compile time problems under OSX.)
 * BugFix : If gSpiceUI has gschem open and a reload operation is executed, the gSchem process is no
            longer closed.
 * Added a mechanism to sch/Makefile to convert all example schematic files included with gSpiceUI
   to netlist files using gnetlist. This provides some level of validation of schematic files,
   although it doesn't guarantee that they will work.
 * Updates to the HTML documentation.
 * Minor updates to man page.
 * Various minor modifications and bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-04-19 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.99 Alpha.
 * BugFix : The Component class wasn't recognizing sub-circuits, transmission-lines or logic devices
            correctly.
 * Minor mods. so that all test utilities compile.
 * Have defined the following types in TypeDefs.hpp : ulong, uint and uchar.
 * It has been reported that "gSpiceUI opens new FIFOs every time gWave, etc. are started but never
   closes them. In a long session the user eventually runs out of file handles". In
   PrcBase::bLogOutput( ) instead of repeatedly getting the input and error streams, get input
   stream pointers once. I've not personally encountered this bug but this might fix it.
 * The sweep sources can now be synchronized. If a sweep source is selected in one analysis page,
   where possible the same source will appear in other analysis pages. This feature may be enabled
   or disabled via the Preferences dialogue.
 * In the class ConvertType replaced all calls to pow10f( ) with calls to pow( ) owing to problems
   compiling the code on OSX.
 * Simplified FrmMain::OnOpen( ), FrmMain::OnImport( ) and FrmMain::OnReload( ) so that most of the
   work is done by the class FileTasks.
 * Simplified FileTasks::bReload( ) so that it calls FileTasks::bOpen( ) and FileTasks::bImport( )
   instead of duplicating code.
 * In the class PrcGNetList remove the functions that aren't really required :
     bSetGNetList( ), rofnGetGNetList( ), szGetGuileProcCnt( ) and szGetSchemFileCnt( ).
 * BugFix : Sort out bugs in the mechanism for loading schematic file/s via the command line.
 * BugFix : Sort out bugs in the mechanism for loading a netlist file via the command line.
 * Added m_iExitCode attribute to PrcBase class to contain the exit code returned when the process
   was last run.
 * Re-organise contents of lib/ directory.
 * Implement function CmdLinePcr::bCheckFiles( ) for basic file name testing.
 * Implement function CmdLinePcr::Print( ) for debugging.
 * BugFix : If errors are encountered by gnetlist the Console tab is displayed instead of the
            NetList tab.
 * BugFix : In dialogs pressing the Clear or Defaults buttons can now reversed by pressing the
            Cancel button.
 * The function PnlValue::bSetValue( wxString, bool ) can now set the units with a value of 0.0
   eg. "0.0msec".
 * BugFix : In FileTasks::InitNetLstFile( ) simulation data was transferred from FrmMain::m_oSimnGcp
            to FrmMain::m_oSimnNgs when it had already been transferred from FrmMain::m_oSimnNgs
            to FrmMain::m_oSimnGcp.
 * BugFix : In CpntNgIndSrc::bParseValue( ) and CpntNgIndSrc::bFormatValue( ) the pulse source
            function was incorrectly formatted; the pulse width appeared ahead of the fall time.
 * Super-conductor junction components are now recognized.
 * The class name AppGSpiceUI has been changed to App_gSpiceUI.
 * BugFix : LC_NUMERIC locale problem reported by Werner H. and Viktor N. Have applied a patch
            provide by Werner : moved the locale call from the AppGSpiceUI constructor to
            AppGSpiceUI::OnInit( ).
 * Documentation updates.
 * Various minor modifications and bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-09-14 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.98 Alpha.
 * BugFix : In the <root>/Makefile the "install" target had the files ReadMe and Install in
            upper-case which caused the install to fail. Bug found by Werner H.
 * BugFix : For NG-Spice simulations columns of results where lost if more than three parameters
            where derived. Class CmdNgSpiceOPT can now set an appropriate page width for the number
            of derived parameters.
 * Updates to the text files : Authors, ChangeLog, Install, ReadMe and ToDo.
 * Add a new command line option "-c" to partially rebuild/clean the configuration file
   ie. ~/.gspiceui.conf.
 * BugFix : The command line processor was not functioning properly when the option "-g" was
            specified without an argument.
 * Some updates to the installation instructions (ie. Install).
 * BugFix : Gaw was used regardless of the setting in the Preferences dialog.
 * In <root>/src/Makefile the debug flag was set by default. This meant that the resulting binary
   was much larger than necessary. The debug flag is now clear by default.
 * There is a new parameter in the preferences dialog which allows the results precision to be
   specified; a lower value means the raw data is easier to read but a higher value provides for
   greater resolution.
 * Brought back the component names in the NG-Spice results column labels.
 * Much of the implementation of the method bMakeArgLst( ) in classes PrcGnuCap and PrcNgSpice has
   been moved to the base class PrcSimrBase.
 * The gSchem ".sym" files in the <root>/lib/ directory where mistakenly omitted from the last
   release.
 * Bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-09-11 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.97 Alpha.
 * Data is now transferred from a NG-Spice simulation object to a GNU-Cap object (and visa-versa) by
   design rather than happenstance.
 * DlgPrefs is no longer an attribute of FrmMain but is created when needed.
 * Tidy up PrcGNetList class source files.
 * Some changes to the installation instructions for wxWidgets (ie. Install).
 * Remove the restriction that the transient analyse must have a signal source.
 * Modified the class DlgGcpCfgGEN so that it is derived from wxDialog only and not CmdGnuCapGEN as
   well.
 * Modified the class DlgGcpCfgOPT so that it is derived from wxDialog only and not CmdGnuCapOPT as
   well.
 * Modified the class DlgNgsCfgSrc so that it is derived from wxDialog only and not CpntNgsIndSrc as
   well.
 * Modified the class DlgNgsCfgOPT so that it is derived from wxDialog only and not CmdNgSpiceOPT as
   well.
 * BugFix : The temporary file management strategy indicator wasn't being stored in the
            configuration file. Changes to FileTasks class and DlgPrefs class.
 * Modified the Component class to handle TABs as field separators in component definitions.
 * Updates to the About dialog.
 * Updates to the command line usage message.
 * Update the "tar" target in the project root Makefile.
 * Modified DlgNgsCfgOPT so that it inherits CmdNgSpiceOPT instead of having an instance as an
   attribute.
 * Modified DlgNgsCfgSrc so that it inherits CpntNgsIndSrc instead of having an instance as an
   attribute.
 * Updates to the class ConvertType. Can now specify a resolution for conversions from floats to
   strings.
 * Updates to the About dialogue contents particularly the licence details.
 * Major re-think and overhaul of the Simulation class to make it easier to understand and maintain.
   It's been replaced with the structures SimnBase, SimnNgSpice and SimnGnuCap.
 * Some classes have now been re-defined as structures so that most of they're attributes have
   public access. This increases they're ease of use since attributes can be accessed directly
   rather than via inline function calls. (It would be nice if C++ had a mechanism for defining
   attributes as read-only to the outside world.)
 * Created a new simulation structure SimnBase from which the new structures SimnNgSpice and
   SimnGnuCap inherit. These structure replace the single Simulation class which had become far too
   complicated.
 * Simplify NetList class.
 * Updated Component class, changed type to structure, it now permits public access to most
   attributes.
 * Added units of pico-seconds (psec) to the units of time in class ChoUnits.
 * Transient analyses may now be run without having to specify a sweep source.
 * Integrated the command classes into the simulation engine process classes.
 * Created new command classes CmdGnuCapOP, CmdGnuCapTR and CmdGnuCapFO for parsing and formatting
   GNU-Cap OP, Transient and Fourier commands.
 * Created new command classes CmdGnuCapPR and CmdGnuCapGEN for parsing and formatting GNU-Cap Print
   and Generator commands.
 * Created new command classes CmdNgSpicePR for parsing and formatting NG-Spice Print commands.
 * Created a new structure CpntNgsIndSrc which inherits from the Component structure. It processes
   NG-Spice independent voltage or current source definition commands.
 * And others things that I've forgotten.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-02-29 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.65 Alpha.
 * A schematic editor (ie. gSchem) can now be envoked from within gSpiceUI via the menuing system or
   the tool bar.
 * Implemented test utilities in all command classes to facilitate debugging.
 * Create new command classes CmdGnuCapDC and CmdGnuCapAC for parsing and formatting GNU-Cap DC and
   AC commands.
 * Created new command classes CmdNgSpiceAC and CmdNgSpiceTR for parsing and formatting NG-Spice AC
   and Transient analysis commands.
 * Modify class PrcNgSpice to use the command classes ie. CmdNgSpiceDC, etc.
 * Created a new class PrcGaw to interface to the waveform viewer Gaw (which is a rewrite of gWave).
 * One of two waveform viewers may now be specified by the user via the command line or the
   preferences dialog ie. gWave or Gaw. This preference is also stored in the configuration file and
   so need only be specified once.
 * Bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-10-25 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.55 Alpha.
 * Various improvements to src/Makefile.
 * Changed the name of the Options menu to Settings to prevent confusion with the SPICE OPTIONS
   command.
 * Fixed a bug in the "make deps" process.
 * Fixed a bug where a reload operation was clearing the units of the stop value in the NG-Spice DC
   analysis. Also fixed many other bugs associated the reload operation in all other analysis
   panels.
 * Minor overhaul of the class PnlNgSpiceDC. Will do the same to all other analysis panel classes in
   the fullness of time.
 * Fixed bug 1759886 "make install: error if ../share/man/man1 is missing" submitted by Werner H.
 * Added the file TypeDefs.hpp to contain mainly the enumerated type definitions used throughout
   gSpiceUI.
 * First cut at controlling the fonts used by gSpiceUI.
 * Added a Clear button to the GNU-Cap Generator Setup dialog and the NG-Spice Signal Source Setup
   dialog.
 * A new class CmdNgSpiceDC has been introduced for parsing and formatting NG-Spice DC analysis
   commands. Ultimately all analysis commands will be processed using this mechanism.
 * The recommended version of the wxWidgets library is still v2.8.x but work has been done to
   improve support for v2.6.x. It seems that wxWidgets v2.8.x has not yet been sufficiently widely
   adopted to make it a requirement.
 * The src/Makefile has been modified so that the version of the wxWidgets library to compile
   against may be specified via the make command line or within the Makefile itself.
 * An upper limit of 9 characters has now been imposed on the number of characters which may be
   entered into a SpinCtrl object.
 * Fixed several bugs associated with the SpinCtrl class.
 * Bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-07-05 : M.Waters

 * Released version 0.9.33 Alpha.
 * Added a sinusoid function to the NG-Spice signal source configuration dialog.
 * Tidy up of the Makefiles.
 * The title line/s in user generated circuit description files are now preserved in the simulation
   file generated by gSpiceUI. Requested by Andres M.
 * Fixed a bugs in the GNU-Cap DC and AC command parsers causing them to break when the start and
   stop sweep values where equal.
 * Adjustments to the size and position of display components.
 * For GNU-Cap the option BASIC has been appended to all analysis lines to suppress the use of alpha
   abbreviations instead of an exponent eg. 3.1u now becomes 3.1E-6. Requested by Andres M.
 * Introduced an .OPTIONS button on each analysis panel and removed the .OPTIONS option in the
   Options menu.
 * Added tooltips to the NG-Spice source component setup dialog and the GNU-Cap generator component
   dialog.
 * Improvements to src/Makefile.
 * NG-Spice negative node values in .PRINT statements were not processed correctly. Eg.
   PRINT TRAN V(0,1) V(0,2) (2 parameters) is interpreted as PRINT TRAN (-V(1)-V(2)) (1 parameter);
   I've found through experiment that PRINT TRAN 0-V(1) 0-V(2) results in the correct intepretation.

 * Added two new operational amplifier models to the lib/opamp directory ie. LM324 (national) and
   LMX358 (maxim).
 * Al Davis reported that the GNU-Cap AC analysis generated by gSpiceUI was missing an .OP command
   prior to the .AC command. The operational amplifier models in the lib/opamp directory can now be
   AC analysed correctly using GNU-Cap.
 * Additions to the documentation.

   better using wxWidgets v2.5.2 or earlier.
 * Command line option added to specify temporary file management strategy ie. "-t <n>", delete the
   files automatically, prompt the user or keep them.
 * Command line options which have not yet been implemented are no longer displayed in the
   application usage message which has also been tidied up.
 * The application frame now cannot be resized using the mouse but the text control display area can
   be resized with a new command line option "-d n".
 * The spin controls have been modified so that the units automatically change to the next logical
   value when appropriate eg. 1000.0mV rolls up to 1.0V and 1.0mV rolls down to 1000.0uV.
 * I have derived an opamp model on which NG-Spice can perform an AC analysis. The model is based on
   the Maxim LMX358 model. I haven't been able to find an opamp model on which GNU-Cap can
   successfully perform an AC analysis. So far I've tried models from National and Maxim.
 * Additions to the documentation.
