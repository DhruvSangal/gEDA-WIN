This release of gSpiceUI is the first in a long time (longer than intended).
I've been building up to version 1.0.00 since the last release but kept putting
it off thinking that the code was never good enough. I've decided to release
this version regardless; if I don't call something version 1.0.00 it might
never happen. However, much of the effort in this release has gone to testing
and bug fixes over new features, so this release should be pretty good.

A notable point about this release is that it can be compiled against the
wxWidgets library version 2.9.2 (with wxWidgets 2.8 compatibility enabled).
This was requested by a Mac OSX user. The limited testing I've done has
revealed that there's more to do however; there are new run-time bugs when
using wxWidgets v2.9.x, but it's a start.

For the time being most development effort will still be centered on wxWidgets
v2.8.x. I don't want to leave anyone behind and there's no compelling reason to
change at present.

The following is an extract from the ChangeLog file associated with this
release :

 * When gSpiceUI is installed example schematic files and library files are now
   included (this was always intended but overlooked).
 * gSpiceUI has been successfully compiled against the wxWidgets library
   version 2.9.2 (with wxWidgets 2.8 compatibility enabled). This was requested
   by a Mac OSX user Jerry J. since "it works better with the Cocoa framework".
 * BugFix : The temporary file management scheme was incomplete. If more than
            one circuit descriptions were loaded in a single session temporary
            files could be created but not deleted.
 * Modifications to the functions in utility/StrUtils.cpp. Signal source names
   are now sorted so that the most used component types appear at the top of
   the list.
 * Modifications to the functions in utility/StrUtils.cpp. The more interesting
   node and component names now tend to be placed at the top of the test probe
   list boxes and the remaining names are sorted more sensibly.
 * In the classes NetList, SimnBase, SimnGunCap and SimnNgSpice change all
   Extract*( ) function names to Load*( ).
 * BugFix : In version v0.9.99 a reload operation would close gschem and gwave
            or gaw. (This was unintended behaviour.)
 * In class SpinCtrl hard-coded a spin button repeat period of 80 msec. This
   will be user configurable in the future.
 * Increased the maximum number of lines which can be displayed in any text
   control to 1,000,000 lines and the default to 10,000. (I don't know if
   wxTextCtrl can cope with this but someone will try it sooner or later and
   we'll find out).
 * Objects inheriting from PrcBase (which itself inherits from wxProcess)
   created input and output streams but didn't deleted them. Eventually all
   available file descriptors were used up and gSpiceUI could no longer launch
   new processes. This long standing bug has been resolved (I think?) thanks to
   a contribution made by Jarno Honkanen.
 * Added a LM555 model file and demo. schematic.
 * In the classes PrcGWave and PrcGaw removed the functions bFormatLine( ) and
   bFormatField( ) because these operations are already performed by PrcGnuCap
   and PrcNgSpice.
 * Over-haul of the ChoUnits class.
 * In the PnlValue::bSetValue( ) methods remove unnecessary complexity by
   eliminating the bNoUnits argument; it's already implemented by the
   PnlValue::m_bUseUnits attribute.
 * BugFix : If a node label didn't start with a digit CmdGnuCapPR::Parse( )
            categorized it as a component label.
 * BugFix : The src/Makefile target "deps" was not correctly defined. Most of
            the source files where being overlooked.
 * In HelpTasks class removed the status bar from the HTML window, it wasn't
   used.
 * Disable the Stop tool and Stop menu option when no simulation is actually
   running.
 * In the HelpTasks class added a tool to the tool bar for moving forward in
   the history database.
 * In the HelpTasks class implemented wxFrame close tool for HTML window.
 * Implemented a new command-line option -d which enables debug mode. This
   causes console spew to be generated on standard error.
 * At startup error messages are held over until the the main frame of the GUI
   has been fully displayed.
 * In src/Makefile added a new variable $DESTDIR which may be used to specify
   the install location at the request of ???.
 * BugFix : The src/Makefile install mechanism failed if the target bin/
            directory didn't already exist.
 * In the classes PnlValue, SpinCtrl and ChoUnits the method bClear( ) is used
   to set defaults. Added a function bSetDefaults( ) to set default values and
   changed the bClear( ) methods to just clear the object attributes.
 * Replace all references to wxWindows with wxWidgets.
 * Minor updates to Install documentation.
 * BugFix : The files utility/iStrCmp.h and utility/iStrCmp.c actually contain
            C++ code so they have been renamed to utility/iStrCmp.hpp and
            utility/iStrCmp.cpp respectively. Also removed instructions for
            compiling C code from Makefile.
 * In the class ConvertType all function for processing double float's take
   only double's of long's as arguments. (This is to do with compile time
   problems under OSX.)
 * BugFix : If gSpiceUI has gschem open and a reload operation is executed, the
            gSchem process is no longer closed.
 * Added a mechanism to sch/Makefile to convert all example schematic files
   included with gSpiceUI to netlist files using gnetlist. This provides some
   level of validation of schematic files, although it doesn't guarantee that
   they will work.
 * Updates to the HTML documentation.
 * Minor updates to man page.
 * Various minor modifications and bug fixes.
